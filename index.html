                <h4>A little about me!</h4>
                <p>Currently I'm a senior at Iowa State University, constantly working on side projects and open source, and drinking a lot of coffee!
                At ISU, I am the Vice President of the Computer Science and Software Engineering club, where I help to organize company events and game nights.
                I am also actively involved in helping to improve the Software Engineering Program as part of the Student Advisory Council. In the past, I've helped
                organize 200+ events as part of the Engineering Events Committee.</p>
                <p>I was born in Muscat, Oman and grew up in Mumbai, India. I went back to Muscat when I was 14 and completed my high school. I once again switched things and came to US to pursue my higher education. These experiences provided me with significant global exposure and played a pivotal role in shaping my personality. I am a quick learner who is constantly looking for different ways to apply my problem solving skills. I find the field of computer science very fascinating as it inspires creativity. I strongly believe that by creating rich and easy to use software products, I can make a positive impact on the lives of millions across the world.</p>
