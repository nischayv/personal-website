                <h4>A little about me!</h4>
                <p>Currently I'm a senior at Iowa State University, constantly working on side projects and open source, and drinking a lot of coffee!
                    At ISU, I am the Vice President of the Computer Science and Software Engineering club, where I help to organize company events and game nights.
                    I am also actively involved in helping to improve the Software Engineering Program as part of the Student Advisory Council. In the past, I've helped
                    organize events for 200+ people as part of the Engineering Events Committee.</p>
                <p>I was born in Muscat, Oman and grew up in Mumbai, India. I went back to Muscat when I was 14 and completed my high school. I once again switched things and came to US to pursue my higher education. These experiences provided me with significant global exposure and played a pivotal role in shaping my personality. I find the field of computer science very fascinating as it inspires creativity. I strongly believe that by creating rich and easy to use software products, I can make a positive impact on the lives of millions across the world.</p>

                <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                <p>Boba-bot is a Slack chatbot that can answer any question by leveraging API.AI's machine learning capabilities,
                    Cleverbot API, Google API's, and Wikipedia. API.AI classifies the questions
                    into different categories. If it is a question like - Are there any restaurants nearby? - then Google Places API is used
                    to answer the question. If it is a question like - Who is Alan Turing - then Wikipedia is scraped to formulate a good
                    answer for the user. The responses for any other types of questions or casual talk is generated using Cleverbot's API.
                    It is deployed using Heroku.

                    Currently, I am looking to graduate with by bachelor’s degree and then pursue a master’s degree in computer science. I want to obtain sufficient knowledge in the field and apply that knowledge to solving real world problem. Specifically, I want to increase the depth of my knowledge in the field of AI and deep learning. I believe that’s where the future is headed. I want to be able to apply all that knowledge by working at a company with high impact products, solving some of the most challenging problems in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel general education classes have played an important part in shaping my overall personality and my approach to solving engineering problems. They allow you to think about problems from a different perspective. Whenever we work on solving an engineering/technical problem, we are solving it for a user or a group of users. Having a better understanding of the people that use the product, their backgrounds, culture, the market, and history of the problem, provides us with additional tools to solve the problem in a more efficient way with ease. I also feel it will provide a different perspective on approaching the problem. General education classes have taught me how to understand these additional non-technical factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The general education classes that I have taken have provided me with incredible insight into local and international economic markets and the history, religions, cultures of people across the globe. ECON 101 taught me how markets operate – from supply demand models to trade. This gave me additional perspectives into the business aspect of things. In my Religion 210 class, I learned about the different religions in the United States, their socio-cultural implications and, how they affect the collective growth of the country. These factors are crucial for larger companies that are building products and services for a large number of people. Also, for engineers in general, most work done these days is high impactful, with the potential to affect millions across the globe. Thus, I believe it is crucial to understand the non-technical aspects of building solutions and solving engineering problems in a global society with a very diverse audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think one problem that society is facing is understanding people of different ethnicities, religions, cultures, and backgrounds. I believe General education classes greatly help in that understanding and in promoting harmony. General education classes like Religion, Women's studies, etc help in bridging the gap between people.
                </p>
                <h3>Ethics</h3>
                <p>
                    VW emissions – If I was a software engineer on the VW team and I found out about the wrong practices happening, I would report it to my seniors. Even though I would be in a situation where I am expected to produce unrealistic results, I would personally never resort to behaving unethically. I would continue to uphold my values. If my seniors encouraged the act of cheating the emissions test in favor of results, I would simply quit. I would go beyond and publicize the unethical things happening within the company if it is causing harm to people, animals, or the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    VW emissions – I feel given the circumstances, the engineers at Volkswagen were faced with a very difficult choice – do whatever it takes to get the expected results or face the consequences. They had to do the impossible or else they would end up losing their jobs. For many, losing their jobs may not be something they could even consider. Also, it seemed like the culture also promoted and encouraged them to act in the way they did by forcing people to show results by whatever means possible – even cheating.
                </p>
                <h3>Cumulative Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    Looking back at my time at Iowa State University, I remember how little I knew when I first started. I came in as a student in computer engineering, but soon realized my interest solely in software, rather than hardware. That prompted me to make a quick switch to Software Engineering. The journey has been a memorable one and marks the beginning of my career in the tech industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my four years at ISU, I have learned many things that has benefitted me in my internships and will continue to do so in my professional career as well. Among the classes I took at ISU, COMS 311 has been among the most useful ones. It taught me how to approach problems from a different perspective and also how to builder faster and efficient solutions to many real world problems. In COMS 309, COMS 319, and Senior Design, I learned how to quickly learn new technologies and build systems that are scalable. My general education classes has played a part in teaching me how to solve problems for a diverse population that consists of people from different cultures, backgrounds, and nationalities. All my classes also focused on ethics and making ethical decisions in the workplace. Many of my classes involved working as part of a team. This taught me how to work past conflicts to deliver results on strict deadlines. To succeed in most of my classes, I used the internet extensively. I would encourage current students to make use of resources provided by the university – library, Teaching Assistants, professors, and also take advantage of the unimaginable amount of knowledge on the internet. There are plenty of online tutorials, blogs, examples, and solved problems to help with any sort of learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time at Iowa State, I have constantly been involved with the community. I have been part of the Google Ignite CS program where I helped mentor high school students in CS fundamentals and encouraged students to pursue STEM careers. Currently I am part of the Software Engineering Student Advisory Council and the VP of the Computer Science Club. Through these organizations I can reach out to a wide range of students and help improve the CS community at ISU. I believe it is my responsibility to help provide students with opportunities I did not have and to help foster and create an environment where everyone can learn and grow. The leadership, teamwork, and planning skills that I learned through all of this will be really valuable in the future. I believe learning is a life long process and it never ends. Recently I have been spending time on financial investing by buying and selling stocks. All the skills I have learned so far have definitely helped me in this new endeavor. I can see patterns in the rise and fall of the value and also have learned to mitigate risk by diversifying my portfolio.
                    The journey through Iowa State has been a great learning experience and also a very humbling one. I have had the opportunity to learn and work with very knowledgeable people. If I had the opportunity to do it all over again, I would probably have spent more time actually enjoying the course material rather than being worried about getting good grades, and also building long lasting connections.
